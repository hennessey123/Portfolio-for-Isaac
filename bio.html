                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate and driven computer science student at Samford University with a keen interest in software development and creative technologies. My journey into the world of coding began with a fascination for how things work, which quickly evolved into a desire to build and create innovative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic career, I have immersed myself in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, and SQL. I enjoy tackling complex problems and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. Beyond the screen, I am an avid musician, finding parallels between the structure of music and the logic of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and as an individual. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on the world, and I am excited to contribute to that future.
