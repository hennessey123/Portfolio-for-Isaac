                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Since first owning a the original DS when I was six years old until i was probably 7 or 8, I found myself spending all of my time thinking about when i would get to play mario bros again, wondering what the next levels or worlds might look like, and unconsciously building the plan I wanted for my life from that point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic career, I have been more engaged with literature and science than programming or computing, providing a basis for how I want to use technology as a tool, but nonetheless enjoying the benefits of having such advanced methods to advance my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goals are to create an atmosphere that helps others have the same enjoyment I have found through computers and share the gospel through the knowledge of the ultimate perfect standard for living. I am especially interested in game design, but know there are many ways to introduce one to faith, without inducing it by brainrot.
